Design of Real Time Patient Health Monitoring System using Internet of Things with Medical Data Storage and Emergency Alert

# Abstract
Remote Patient Health Monitoring System uses ATMEGA 328P microcontroller (Ardiuno) for computations. The sensors attached to the patientâ€™s body collect the pulse rate and temperature data and transmits the data to an IoT server for further analysis. The doctors can draw the conclusions from the medical record and take the necessary actions to avoid the health risks. The care-takers will be alerted through e-mail and telegram during the emergency situations. The data will also be stored in Google sheets which can be used for treatment recommendations.

# Objective
The objectives of the patient health monitoring system are:
1. Data Acquisition: Collecting the temperature and pulse rate.
2. Data Transmission: Transmitting the collected data to an IoT server.
3. Alerting: Alerting the caretakers through Gmail and telegram messenger during   emergency situations.
4. Cloud Storage: Storing the data in Google Sheets
